<h1>Maze Program Documentation</h1>
<h3>The program is developed by students of School 21: yonnarge, marbrand, madamkyl</h3>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
    The Maze program is a desktop application that allows solving two-dimensional mazes.
</p>

<h2>Generation</h2>
<p>
    In the Maze program, you can generate an ideal maze according to the Eller's algorithm without closed areas and loops by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choosing the desired number of columns and rows in the maze</li>
    <li>Clicking the "Generate" button</li>
    <li>When clicking the "Solve" button, the maze will find a path from the top left cell to the bottom right</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that you can use your own start and end points. Simply click on the desired cells.
</p>

<p>
    Importing a maze from a txt file is available in the following format.
</p>
<p>
    The file contains two numbers - the number of rows and columns, as well as two matrices containing the position of vertical and horizontal walls, respectively.
</p>
Example:<br>
4 4<br>
0 0 0 1<br>
1 0 1 1<br>
0 1 0 1<br>
0 0 0 1<br>
<br>
1 0 1 0<br>
0 0 1 0<br>
1 1 0 1<br>
1 1 1 1<br>
</p>

<p>
    The generated maze can be exported to a txt file in the format described above.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    When using the Maze program, the following limitations should be considered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum maze size - 50 x 50 cells.</li>
    <li>Building solutions is only available for two points.</li>
    <li>The maze cannot be scaled - the field is set to a size of 500 x 500 pixels, with a line width of 2 pixels.</li>
    <li>Passage width - 1 cell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of Use</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Set the desired width and height</li>
    <li>Click on an empty maze field to generate</li>
    <li>Select the start point with the next mouse click</li>
    <li>Then also select the end point</li>
    <li>The next click will clear the field from the solution</li>
</ul>
